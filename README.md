# Fwd Store Frontend

## Description

A Project in the [egFWD](https://egfwd.com/) initiative (full-stack nanodegree).
It presents the basic functionalities of a store frontend website.

## Instructions

After downloading the project here's a couple of things you should do in order to run it:

1. install packages

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   I didn't install any outside dependencies but you have to use it to install the default node modules.

2. run the app

   ```shell
   ng serve
   ```

   This will start the dev server at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:4200/) in your browser.
