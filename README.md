# Fwd Store Frontend

## Description

A Project in the [egFWD](https://egfwd.com/) initiative (full-stack nanodegree).
It presents the basic functionalities of a store frontend website.
While navigating the store app, the user may see what items are there in the products gallery and he may add items to his cart. Through his cart , he may update his order items as he like and submit it when he is satisfied.

## Instructions

After downloading the project here's a couple of things you should do in order to run it:

1. install packages

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   I didn't install any outside dependencies but you have to use it to install the default node modules.

2. run the app

   ```shell
   ng serve
   ```

   This will start the dev server at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:4200/) in your browser.

## Credits

This frontend app couldn't be done without the efforts made by [Mohammad Reza @keikaavousi](https://github.com/keikaavousi) on his easy to use [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), Thanks Mohammad, you built an api that made my learning journey easier ^^
